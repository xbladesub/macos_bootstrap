# Bootstrap script for setting up a new OSX machine
# 
# This should be idempotent so it can be run multiple times.
#

# Notes:
#
# Some apps don't have a cask and so still need to be installed by hand
#
# - If installing full Xcode, it's better to install that first from the app
#   store before running the bootstrap script. Otherwise, Homebrew can't access
#   the Xcode libraries as the agreement hasn't been accepted yet.
